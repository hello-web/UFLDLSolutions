UFLDL solutions in c# and .Net for  http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial :

1- Self Taught Learning.

2- Extract Color Features.

3- Convolutional Neural Network

for best performance run without debuging

implemented algorithms:

1- Sparce Autoencoder.

2- Whitning.

3- Softmax.

4- Linear Autoencoder.

5- Convolution (Full,Same,Valid).

6- Mean Pooling.

also I wrote usful mathematical functions that can be used to implement new algorithms.
